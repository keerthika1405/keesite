<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h3>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to provide a framework for designing and understanding computer networks. The development of the OSI model began in the late 1970s, and the standard was first published in 1984</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Late 1970s:</b> The need for a standardized model for networking was recognized as computer networks were becoming increasingly complex. Different networking technologies were emerging, and there was a lack of consistency in how these technologies communicated with each other.</li>
<li><b>Early 1980s:</b> The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) initiated efforts to create a universal networking model that could serve as a reference for network development and interoperability. </li>
<li><b>1983:</b> The OSI model was officially introduced as a conceptual framework to standardize network communications. It aimed to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the various layers involved in network communication</li>
<li><b>1984:</b> The OSI model was published as international standard ISO 7498. This standard defined seven abstraction layers, each serving a specific purpose in the process of network communication</li>
</ol>
<h3>There isn't a specific physical location associated with the development of the OSI model because it involved contributions from experts and organizations around the world. </h3>
<h1>Seven Layer</h1>
<ol>
    <li><b>Physical Layer:</b> </li>
    <p>This layer deals with the physical connection between devices. It defines the hardware elements involved, such as cables, switches, and network interface cards</p>
    <li><b>Data Link Layer:</b> </li>
    <p>This layer is concerned with creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes. It ensures that data packets are delivered error-free and in the correct order.</p>
    <li><b>Network Layer:</b></li>
    <p> The network layer is responsible for determining the best path for data packets to reach their destination across a network. It handles routing and forwarding of data between different networks.</p>
    <li><b>Transport Layer:</b></li>
    <p>The transport layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between devices on different hosts. It ensures that data is delivered reliably and in the correct sequence. Protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) operate at this laye</p>
    <li><b>Session Layer:</b></li>
    <p> The session layer manages and maintains communication sessions between applications on different devices. It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections, ensuring that data is properly synchronized and organized</p>
    <li><b>Presentation Layer:</b></li>
    <p> This layer deals with data translation and encryption, ensuring that information sent from one system can be understood by the recipient system. It is responsible for data compression, encryption, and protocol conversion.</p>
    <li><b>Application Layer:</b></li>
    <p> The application layer provides network services directly to end-users or applications. It enables communication between different applications and provides various network services like email, file transfer, and remote access.</p>
</ol>

    <h1 style="color:rgb(200, 8, 62);">physical layer</h1>
    
    <h3>This layer deals with the physical connection between devices
        <br>the transmission and reception of raw data bits over a physical medium such as cables or wireless signals</h3>
    <h4>key function</h4>
    <h3> <b style="color: rgb(200, 8, 62)">Physical Media:</b> The Physical Layer defines the types of cables and connections used to transmit data, such as Ethernet cables, fiber-optic cables, or wireless <br> It also includes specifications for connectors, switches, and other networking hardware</h3> 
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(200, 8, 62)">Data Rate and Bandwidth:</b>  It specifies the data rate, which is the speed at which data is transmitted over the network. It is usually measured in bits per second (bps). Bandwidth refers to the maximum data rate that a communication channel can support</h3>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(200, 8, 62)">Topology:</b>  The Physical Layer defines the physical layout or topology of the network, such as bus, star, ring, or mesh topology. Different network topologies have different implications for how data is transmitted and how devices are connected.</h3>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(200, 8, 62)">Transmission Modes: </b>The Physical Layer supports different transmission modes, including simplex (one-way communication), half-duplex (two-way communication, but not simultaneously), and full-duplex (two-way communication simultaneously).</h3>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(200, 8, 62)">Physical Signaling:</b> It includes specifications for electrical voltages, light pulses (in fiber-optic communication), or radio waves (in wireless communication) used to transmit data bits over the physical medium.</h3>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(200, 8, 62)">Bit Order:</b> The Physical Layer defines the order in which bits are transmitted over the medium, such as most significant bit first (MSB) or least significant bit first (LSB).</h3>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(200, 8, 62)">Data Encoding:</b> It specifies how digital data is encoded into signals for transmission. Different encoding schemes, such as Manchester encoding or NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) encoding, are used to represent binary data as electrical or optical signals.</h3>

<div class="datalinklayer" id="section2">
    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <h1 style="color:rgb(11, 200, 8);">Data Link layer</h1>
    <h3>This layer is responsible for creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes on a network. <br>
        It ensures that data frames are delivered error-free and in the correct order between devices on the same local network. <br>
        The Data Link Layer achieves this by providing mechanisms for framing, addressing, error detection, and flow control</h3>
    <h4>key function</h4>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Framing:</b> The Data Link Layer encapsulates network layer packets into frames. Frames include control information, such as source and destination MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, as well as error-checking mechanisms like Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for ensuring data integrity during transmission.</h3> 
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">MAC Addressing:</b>Each network device, such as network interface cards (NICs) and switches, has a unique MAC address assigned to its hardware. The Data Link Layer uses MAC addresses to identify the source and destination of data frames within a local network</h3>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Error Detection and Correction:</b> The Data Link Layer detects errors in transmitted frames <br>using techniques like Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). If errors are detected, the frames can be retransmitted to ensure data integrity.</h3>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Flow control:</b>Flow control mechanisms prevent fast senders from overwhelming slow receivers. This is particularly important in scenarios where data transmission rates differ between sender and receiver devices. Flow control ensures that data is sent at a rate that the receiver can handle without dropping frames..</h3>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Switching: </b> Switching is transparent to the user and does not require any configuration in the home network. Switches are used to forward the packets based on MAC addresses. A Switch is used to transfer the data only to the device that has been addressed <br>
        Unlike hubs, switches are more intelligent and forward frames only to the specific devices that need them, reducing network congestion and improving efficiency.</h3>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Logical Link Control (LLC) Sublayer</b>The LLC sublayer of the Data Link Layer handles error checking and flow control. It also manages logical links between devices on a network, allowing multiple network protocols to share the same physical medium.</h3>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)"> Media Access Control (MAC) Sublayer:</b> The MAC sublayer is responsible for controlling access to the network medium. It determines how devices on a shared network can access and use the physical channel without causing data collisions. Ethernet protocols like CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) operate at this sublayer</h3>

    <img src="osimage/frame.jpg" frameborder="0" width="800px" height="500px"></img>
    <h3><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Frame Structure</b></h3>
    <img src="osimage/ethernetframeformate.jpg" frameborder="0" width="800px" height="200px"></img>
    <ul>
      <h3>Header</h3>

      <li><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Preamble: </b>The preamble is a series of bits (usually 7 bytes) at the beginning of the frame. It helps the receiving device synchronize its clock with the sender's clock. Synchronization is essential for the receiver to understand the timing of the incoming bits.</li>
      <li><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Start Frame Delimiter (SFD): </b> The SFD marks the end of the preamble and indicates the start of the frame's actual data. It tells the receiver where the frame's header begins.</li>
      <li><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Destination MAC Address: </b> This field contains the MAC address of the device to which the frame is being sent. Devices on the same network read the destination MAC address to determine if the frame is intended for them. The length of this field is typically 6 bytes.</li>
      <li><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Source MAC Address: </b> This field contains the MAC address of the sender or source device. It informs the recipient of the frame about the sender's identity. Like the destination MAC address, this field is usually 6 bytes long.</li>
      <li><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">EtherType or Length: </b> In Ethernet frames, this field indicates the type of data in the frame. If the value in this field is greater than or equal to 1536 (0x600 in hexadecimal), it represents the EtherType, specifying the protocol carried in the frame (such as IPv4 or IPv6). If the value is less than or equal to 1500 (0x05DC in hexadecimal), it indicates the Length of the frame.</li>
    
      <h3>Payload</h3>
      <li><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Data: </b> This section of the frame contains the actual payload data from the higher layers of the OSI model. It could be an IP packet, a TCP segment, or any other higher-layer data.</li>
      <h3>Trailer</h3>
      <li><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Frame Check Sequence (FCS): </b>The FCS is a field at the end of the frame used for error detection. It is generated by the sender based on the contents of the frame. When the frame is received, the recipient recalculates the FCS based on the received frame data. If the calculated FCS does not match the received FCS, the frame is considered corrupted and is typically discarded </li>
      <li><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">End of Frame (EOF): </b>  The EOF marks the end of the frame. It signifies to the receiver that the frame transmission is complete</li>
      <li><b style="color: rgb(11, 200, 8)">Flag: </b> It contains the points to the starting and the ending of the frame.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="networklayer" id="section3">
  <br><br><br><br><br>
  <h1 style="color:rgb(10, 195, 202);">Network layer</h1>
  
  <h3>The Network Layer is responsible for managing logical addressing, routing, and the delivery of data packets from the source to the destination across multiple networks.</h3>
  <h4>key function</h4>
  <h3> <b style="color: rgb(10, 195, 202)">Logical Addressing:</b> Devices on a network are identified by logical addresses, such as IP (Internet Protocol) addresses in the case of the Internet. The Network Layer adds a header to the data packet, including the source and destination IP addresses</h3> 
  <h3><b style="color: rgb(10, 195, 202)">Data Rate and Bandwidth:</b>Routing is the process of determining the optimal path for data packets to travel from the source to the destination. Routers are devices that operate at the Network Layer and use routing algorithms and tables to forward packets along the appropriate paths. They make decisions based on the destination IP address, network topology, and other factors.</h3>
  <img src="osimage/routers1.png" frameborder="0" width="800px" height="500px"></img>
  <h3><b style="color: rgb(10, 195, 202)">Packet Forwarding:</b> The Network Layer encapsulates data packets into packets. Each packet contains a header with source and destination IP addresses, among other information. Routers use this header information to forward packets towards their destination. Routing protocols, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), are used to exchange routing information between routers.</h3>
  <img src="osimage/protocol.webp" frameborder="0" width="800px" height="500px"></img>
  <img src="osimage/routers.png" frameborder="0" width="800px" height="500px"></img>
 

  <h3><b style="color: rgb(10, 195, 202)">Fragmentation and Reassembly: </b> The Network Layer can fragment large packets into smaller pieces for transmission over networks with smaller maximum frame sizes. Fragmentation allows data to be transmitted across networks with different media types and sizes. At the destination, these fragments are reassembled back into the original packet.</h3>
  <img src="osimage/fragment.png" frameborder="0" width="800px" height="500px"></img>
  <h3><b style="color: rgb(10, 195, 202)">Quality of Service (QoS): </b> The Network Layer can support QoS mechanisms, allowing different types of traffic to be prioritized based on requirements such as bandwidth, latency, and reliability. QoS ensures that critical applications, like voice and video, receive higher priority and better network resources than less time-sensitive applications.</h3>
  <h3><b style="color: rgb(10, 195, 202)">Logical Network Address Translation (NAT):  </b>: NAT is a Network Layer function used to modify network address information in packet headers while in transit. It is often used to allow multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IP address, enabling them to access resources on the internet.</h3>
  <h3><b style="color: rgb(10, 195, 202)"> IPv4 and IPv6: </b> IP (Internet Protocol) is the primary protocol used at the Network Layer. IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) are specific implementations of IP, with IPv6 designed to address the limitations of IPv4, particularly its limited address space.</h3>
  <img src="osimage/ip.jpg" frameborder="0" width="800px" height="500px"></img>
  <img src="osimage/ip1.webp" frameborder="0" width="800px" height="500px"></img>
  <br><br>
  <h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An IP address is a 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a host (computer or other device, such as a printer or router) on a TCP/IP network. IP addresses are normally expressed in dotted-decimal format, with four numbers separated by periods</li>
      <li>Each number in the set can range from 0 to 255. So, the full IP addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255</li>
    <li>Types of IP addresses </li>
      <h3><b style="color: rgb(10, 195, 202)">Private: </b>A private network is a computer network that uses its own private address space of IP addresses while connected to the Internet. In home, office, and enterprise environments, these addresses are often used for local area networks. Private IP address ranges are defined under both IPv4 and IPv6 standards.
      The IANA reserves the following IPv4 address ranges for private internets, according to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) document RFC-1918, and they are not publicly routable on the global internet:</h3>
      <h3><b style="color: rgb(10, 195, 202)">Public: </b>An IPv4 address that can be seen on the internet is known as a public IP address. A public IP address is required for any resource in your domain that must be directly accessible from the internet.
        For communication between hosts on the worldwide Internet, public IP addresses can be utilized. The IP address assigned to the home's network by the ISP is known as a public IP address. By logging into the router configuration, it is also accessible locally in this situation</h3>
      <li> Public IP addresses come in two types: dynamic IP addresses and static IP addresses.</li>
      <h3><b style="color: rgb(10, 195, 202)">Dynamic IP Addresses: </b> A dynamic IP address refers to an address assigned to a device temporarily by an ISP. Dynamic IP addresses are typically assigned to devices such as computers, smartphones, or routers. They provide a level of anonymity and security as the IP address changes periodically, making it more difficult to track a specific device or user. When a device connects to the ISP's network, it is assigned an available IP address from a pool. This address is then borrowed for a specific duration before being returned to the pool and assigned to another device.</h3>      
      <h3><b style="color: rgb(10, 195, 202)">Static IP Addresses: </b> A static IP address is a fixed address assigned to a device that remains constant. They are typically used for hosting websites or running servers. By having a fixed IP address, users can easily connect domain names to their servers, ensuring that their websites or services are always accessible. Static addresses are manually configured either on the device itself or by the network administrator. Static IP addresses are typically provided by the user’s ISP or network administrator, and typically come at an additional cost</h3>
