  <h1>what is git?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>git is a free, open-source distributed version control system tool designed to track changes in <br>
      computer files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people with speed and efficiency</li>
      <li>used for source code management in software development</li>
      <li>used to keep track of changes in any set of files.</li>
      <li> git is one of the most widely used VCSs and it has become the de-facto standard of versioning,<br>
         adopted by both open source as well as corporations in their development toolbelt.</li>
      <li>git is called a DVCS (Distributed Version Control System)due to having a distributed architecture</li>
      <li>Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as<br>
         is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN),</li>
      <li>In git, every developer’s working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.</li>
     
  </ul>
  <h1>A brief history of git?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>In April 2005, while working on the 2.6.12 version of the Linux operating system,<br>
      Linus Benedict Torvalds was not pleased with the existing VCSs available in the market to help him manage his code <br>
      So he decided that he needed to create his own VCS to keep track of changes in the Linux core.</li>
      <li>Although GIT is sometimes referred to as Global Information Tracker, Linus Torvalds the creator <br>
        of GIT and Linux confirmed that GIT is named after the word “git”. <br>
        In British English slang “git” means a stupid or unpleasant person.
        Linus Torvalds explained that he believes that he is egotistical and stated <br>
        “I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git.”<br>
      <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/linuxs-linus-torvalds-sorry-for-being-a-jerk#:~:text=Linux%20creator%20Linus%20Torvalds%20is,both%20unprofessional%20and%20uncalled%20for.">story why in year of 2015 linus named it as a GIT  </a></li>
      </ul>
  <h1>Why is git called ‘the stupid content tracker’?</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>The earlier versions of git were barely accessible, and it wasn’t really trying to be smart. <br>
    Basically, it’s just a file system because, as Linus Torvalds explained, file systems are something he understands.<br>
     Tools were built on top to make it more accessible for more people, and as such, it seems smarter, <br>
     but it’s really not trying to be smarter than it should be.<br>
     This is a good thing because it means that it is in our means to correct something that might go wrong<br>
      and mostly understand its inner workings, which helps us to use the tools better.</li>
     <ul><br><br>
      <h3>The git model is quite simple.</h3>
      <li>A blob is a bunch of bytes that represent the content of a file at a point in time.<br>
         It is important to note that it is the contents that are stored and tracked, not the files, their types, or filenames.</li>
      <li>A tree is a collection of blobs. Directories in git basically correspond to trees.</li>
      <li>A commit is a reference to a tree that also contains a reference to one or more parent commits <br>
        (and some metadata, like a date, an author’s name, some explanatory text, etc.)</li>  
      <li>A tag is an object that provides a permanent shorthand name for a particular commit.</li>
      <li>The above are the four main object types in git, the first three being the most important to really understand the main functions of git.<br>
     All of these types of objects are stored in the git object database, which is kept in the git directory, also known as a git repository.</li>
  </ul> <br><br>
  <p>
    That’s it. Notice there’s nothing about patches, diffs, lines added or removed, etc. From the git conceptual model,<br>
     each revision is a complete copy of the whole project.<br>
    git is a stupid content tracker because it has no idea what’s inside those blobs,<br>
     and it doesn’t try to store fine-grained information like “lines 235–250 added, lines 404–410 removed,” or anything like that.<br>
      git doesn’t know anything about the type of content you put in it.<br>
     It does, however, give you the exact content you put in it back out.
  </p>
    </ul><br><br>
    <h1>Collaborating on git projects</h1>
    <p>
  To collaborate on git projects with other developers, you need to be able to manage remote repositories. A remote repository is,<br>
  at its core, another instance of the repository you’re working in that is linked so that changes made to one can be pushed to the other.<br>
  The remote repository could be hosted on a git hosting service like GitHub or GitLab,<br>
  it could be on a co-worker’s machine, or it could even be another folder on your local machine.<br> <br>
  In a typical git project, there is one remote repository known as the “Central” repository. The central repo is almost always hosted either on a<br>
  private server setup for this explicit purpose or on a git hosting service. Since creating your own git server is fairly complex,<br>
  most people rely on a git hosting service to house their central repositories.<br><br>
  
  The most widely used git hosting service in the world today is GitHub. GitHub offers all of the distributed version control and source code management<br>
  (SCM) functionality of git and adds on the top of it its own features for code review, project management, integrations with other developer tools,<br>
  team management, and documentation. The other alternative git hosting services like GitLab and BitBucket also have similar features.<br><br>
  
  However, these services are owned by corporations and carry many risks like vulnerable to censorship, single point of failure, lack of community <br>
  say in policy-making, etc. These problems have encouraged many developers to start looking at alternative git hosting services to host their repositories.<br>
  
  
  Gitopia is a decentralized git hosting service with many added features to make collaboration on code easy and accessible. Gitopia proposes a system that stores <br>
  git repositories in a decentralized network, one that is highly accessible, censorship-resistant, and empowers communities to innovate, create and contribute open-source code.<br>
  Gitopia introduces git version control to a wider audience. Gitopia, by using git as its base for version control and collaboration,<br>
  empowers its users to track the history of changes as people and communities collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves,<br>
  the community can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time.<br>
  
  Developers can review project history to find out:<br>

      <h1>why should learn git?</h1>
      <h3>start with example</h3>
      <p>
        <mark>Imagine you are coloring on a flower-theme coloring book. You just thoroughly colored in green for the leaves and now it's time for you to get to the best part,
         coloring the petal. You know you enjoy red the best but it looked horrible after you finished it. With git, you can revert your choice of red in a heartbeat and 
         you are also free to reapply the red if you change your mind. You sister came across your coloring book and she wants a piece of this. This is your coloring book and 
          you don't trust her color-theory ability. With Git, you can grant her access to this coloring book; where she can copy the current state of your work and give it her own spin.
         Once she is done with it, you can accept or deny her work without affecting yours. With Git, a work doesn't have to be permanent; every action is recorded, reversible, and shareable.</mark></p>
         <ul>
          <li>Leverage online tutorials</li>
          <p> override the code as the series continues. For example, the code from episode 1 gets replaced by the code from episode 2. They leave us with only the latest version of the code.
            Git saves all versions of code as a separate commit. Therefore, we will have a variety of references when we develop our own project.</p>
          <li>Rollback a mistake</li>
          <p>We learn a lot by wrestling with bugs.
            Nonetheless, there will be the time when we are stuck. For instance, bug logs are not helpful,<br>
            Google gives a bunch of irrelevant results, or community supports, such as StackOverflow, don’t understand our problems.     
            Git creates a checkpoint where we can rollback to, reassess the strategy, and get back in the ring.     
            Furthermore, a rollback encourages trial-and-error.<br>
            We experiment with the code, rollback if not satisfied, until we come up with the most elegant solution.</p>
          <li>Learn to break things down</li>
          <p>To leverage a rollback, a commit must be small. We would rather rollback 20 lines of code than 200 lines.
            Using Git trains us to break a big problem down into small committable units. Breaking things down helps devising a bird-eye-view plan. <br>
            The clear directional plan saves us from getting lost in the maze of code.</p>
          <li>Revision made easy</li>
          <p>How many of us return to the project after a long while and it looks at us as we are a stranger?</p><br>
          <p><mark> — Programmer “Hey, sweetheart,”<br>
            — Project      “Do I know you?”   <br>   
            — Programmer  “Com’ on! I’ve been away for a while, but I never stop thinking about you,” <br>    
            — Project      …  <br> 
            — Programmer  “Oh, please. Not again,” 
          </mark>
            <br>
            Looking at an old project can be bewildering, if not intimidating. The project repository consists of numerous files.<br>
             Each file contains hundreds, if not thousands, lines of code.      <br>
            We rub our head and question,<br>
            
            “Where do I start?”  <br>
            Git gives us the simple answer,<br>
            
            “Start with the first commit and work the way up to where we left off.”     <br>
            It helps us track the flow of the development, thus speeds up the revision.</p>
            <br><p>
              Git stores versions of code as a reference that helps speeding up learning and revision. It also encourages trial-and-error and trains us to plan before we code

         <h1>git workflow</h1>
         <p>Gitflow comes from the combination of “Git” and “workflow”. Gitflow is a popular Git branching model that organizes work into five or more branch types.  </p>
         <p>These types of branches are the main branch, develop branch, feature branch, release branch, and hotfix branch.</p>
         <p>Gitflow helps teams organize their work so that they can quickly and visually describe the workflows associated with their branching strategy and releases.</p>    
         <ul>
           <li>Step 1: Start with Your Master Branch</li>
           <p>The master branch of your gitflow diagram describes production releases, so all changes and development work completed funnel up to this branch. 
          <br>You can add additional circles to represent additional product releases and versions moving down this branch.
           </p>
           <li>step 2: Draw a Development Branch for Work in Progress</li>
           <p>The second branch in your gitflow diagram is the development branch<br>
             This branch is used throughout the development process for pre-production code — so a lot of work between released versions of your product will branch off of this line.</p>
         <li>Step 3: Connect Your Branches to Show Where Work is Created and Merged</li>
         <p>Using the connector tool, draw arrows between the circles on the master and development branches to show where work is being created and merged.</p>
         <li>Step 4: Add Additional Branches for Features, Releases, and Hotfixes</li>
         <p>While most of the work will take place on the develop branch and the master branch tracks what work is completed and released, <br>
           there are three additional branches to support your work. These are the release, hotfix, and feature branches.<br>
           Add feature branches below your develop branch; this allows you to describe the workflow of specific features being developed off of and merged back onto the development branch.<br>
           If you add a release branch or hotfix branch, it would sit between the develop and master branches because it describes work being done to move work from development to the product.  </p>

          <h1>type of git workflow</h1>
          <h2>Five Popular Git workflows For Better Code</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Centralized Workflow</li>
            <p>The centralized workflow is a simple and straightforward approach to using Git.<br>
              there is a single central repository with a "master" branch where all developers push their changes. This workflow is similar to using a traditional version control system like Subversion<br>
              Benefits of the centralized workflow include its simplicity and reduced overhead. With a single branch, developers can focus on making changes without the complexity of managing multiple branches.
            </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
             <li>Create a central repository on a remote server, such as GitHub or GitLab.</li> 
              <li>Clone the repository locally, so each developer has their own working copy.</li>
              <li>Make changes to the code locally, then commit and push these changes to the central repository.</li>
              <li>Be aware that the centralized workflow can lead to merge conflicts if multiple developers are working on the same file simultaneously. To mitigate this, ensure developers communicate effectively <br>
                and consider adopting a code review process to minimize conflicts.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <li>Feature Branch Workflow</li>
            <p>The feature branch workflow is a popular approach that isolates the development of individual features in separate branches. Doing so helps maintain a clean and stable master<br>
               branch while allowing developers to experiment and iterate on their features.<br>
               Benefits of the feature branch workflow include improved collaboration and reduced risk of breaking the main branch. By isolating feature development, teams can better manage and integrate their work.</p>
          <ul>
      <li>Create a new branch for each feature, ideally with a descriptive name.</li>
      <li>Make changes and commit them to the feature branch.</li> 
      <li>When the feature is complete, merge it back into the master branch, resolving any conflicts.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that managing multiple feature branches can become complex. </li>
      <li>Establish a clear naming convention for branches and ensure developers communicate about their work to avoid confusion</li>        
      </ul>
       <li>Gitflow Workflow</li>   
       <p>The Gitflow workflow is an advanced branching model designed to support complex projects with multiple release cycles. It involves several branches, including "master," "develop," "feature," "release," and "hotfix" branches.
        <br><br>In Gitflow, the master branch represents the latest stable release, while the development branch is used for ongoing development. Feature branches are created from the development branch, and once completed, <br>
        they are merged back into development. When a release is ready, a release branch is created from development and eventually merged into the master. Hotfix branches are used to address critical issues in production and are merged directly into the master.
      <p>Benefits of the Gitflow workflow include its structured approach to managing releases and addressing issues in production. This model is well-suited for projects with strict release schedules or those requiring a high degree of stability.</p> 
      <br>To set up the Gitflow workflow, consider using a Git extension like "git-flow," which automates the process and enforces best practices. For a more organized version control history, explore techniques like Git squash commit to enhance code quality.</p>
       
      <li>Forking Workflow</li>
      <p>The forking workflow is commonly used in open-source projects and encourages collaboration by allowing contributors to work independently. In this model, each developer forks the main repository, creating their own copy. They make changes in their fork<br>
         and submit pull requests to the original repository when their work is complete.</p>
         <p>Benefits of the forking workflow include its ability to support a large number of contributors and its emphasis on maintaining a clean and stable main repository. This workflow is particularly useful for open-source projects,<br>
           where developers from different backgrounds and skill levels contribute.</p>
           <ul>
            <li> Fork the main repository to create a personal copy.</li>
            <li>Clone the forked repository locally and make changes.</li>
            <li>Push the changes to the forked repository.</li>
            <li>Submit a pull request to the main repository, requesting that your changes be merged.</li>
            <li>To keep your fork up-to-date with the main repository, regularly fetch and merge changes. Additionally,<br>
               ensure that you communicate with the project maintainers and follow the project's guidelines for submitting pull requests.</li>
           </ul>
      <li>Pull Request Workflow</li>
           <p>The pull request workflow is centered around the concept of code reviews and collaboration. In this model,<br>
             developers create branches for their work and submit pull requests when their changes are ready for review.<br>
             Team members review the changes, provide feedback, and approve or request modifications before the changes are merged into the main branch.</p>
             <p>Benefits of the pull request workflow include improved code quality, knowledge sharing, and a collaborative development process.<br>
               This workflow is often used in conjunction with other workflows, like the feature branch workflow or the Gitflow workflow.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new branch for your work, following your team's naming conventions.</li>
        <li>Make changes and commit them to the new branch.</li>
        <li>Push the branch to the remote repository and create a pull request.</li>
        <li>Reviewers provide feedback, and the author addresses any requested changes.</li>
        <li>Once approved, the pull request is merged into the main branch.</li>
        <li>Best practices for pull requests include providing a clear and concise description, keeping the scope of the changes small and focused, and addressing feedback promptly.</li>
      </ul>

        <h1>git vs bash vs gitbash</h1>
        <p>Every Windows PC comes with Command Prompt (cmd), a command-line textual interface to your operating system. Using Command Prompt, you can install programs, create new users, and run scripts.,<br>
          The closest equivalent to Command Prompt for Unix-like machines is Bash. Bash is often seen as superior because of its powerful features. These include arithmetic, array variables, loops, and branches.<br>
          Git Bash provides Windows users with access to Bash and its advanced features.
          <ul>
      <li>What Is Git?</li>
            <p>Git is a version control system. It tracks the changes you make to a collection of files using commits. Commits allow you to capture the state of a project at a particular point in time.<br>
               And Git allows you to go back to a previous commit whenever you want.
              You can install and run Git locally or use one of its online hosts (such as GitHub or Bitbucket).<br>
               But Git is fundamentally a Unix-style command-line utility program. It even comes installed on some macOS and Linux systems.<br>
              Git is probably the most popular version control system in the world today. This is due to its collaborative features.<br>
               Branching allows you to create independent local versions of a codebase that you can later merge with others.<br>
               This is one of the main reasons why programmers use Git to share their contributions to source code development.       
              Git is also open source, free to use, and easy to learn.</p>
      <li>What Is Bash?</li>
              <p>The acronym Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell.The Bourne shell is used for scripting. It provides command-based programming to interpret and execute user commands. As a user types a command,<br>
                 the shell interprets it so the operating system can take action, such as automating a task. The Bourne shell was the default shell for Unix version 7.<br>
                 Bash has all the Bourne shell core features such as grammar and variable expansion
               </p>
      <li>What Is Git Bash?</li>
                 <p>Although Git is a collection of command-line utility programs, you can use it on Windows via a GUI-based app. Bash is only available on Unix-like operating systems, like macOS and Linux.
                  Git Bash is strictly for Microsoft Windows users. It provides an emulation of both Git and the Bash command-line environment.<br>
                   Installing Git Bash on your Windows machine gives you access to a shell environment that is native to macOS and Linux users.</p>
      
                  </ul>

          <h1>why we need to run linux command on window with help of gitbash?</h1>
          <p>A Linux command is a program or utility that runs on the command line. A command line is an interface that accepts lines of text and processes them into instructions for your computer.</p>
          <p>You probably know what Git is. It’s a version control system developed by Linux creator Linus Torvalds.<br>
            Git for Windows is a set of tools that allows you to use Git in both command line and graphical interfaces. One of the tools included in Git for Windows is Git Bash.   <br> 
            Git Bash application provides and emulation layer for Git command line. Apart from Git commands, Git Bash also supports many Bash utilities such as ssh, scp, cat, find etc.<br>
            In other words, you can run many common Linux/Bash commands using the Git Bash application</p>

            <h1>feature of git?</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Distributed:</li>
              <p> Git is a distributed version control system that enables developers to work on a codebase without needing to be connected to a central server
                This allows for a more flexible and decentralized workflow, as developers can work independently and merge their changes later.
              </p>
              <li>Branching and merging:</li>
              <p>Branching and merging: Git enables developers to create and manage branches of a codebase, which allows for parallel development and experimentation.<br>
                 Git also provides tools for merging branches back into the main codebase, ensuring that changes are integrated smoothly.</p>
            <li>History tracking:</li>
            <p>Git maintains a detailed history of all changes made to a codebase, enabling developers to track the evolution of the codebase over time. <br>
              This history can also be used to revert changes or to identify the source of bugs.</p>
            <li>Staging:</li>
            <p>Git provides a staging area, also known as the index, where changes can be reviewed and prepared for committing to the codebase. <br>
              This enables developers to carefully review and selectively commit changes, rather than committing all changes at once.</p>  
            <li>Speed: </li>
            <p> Git is designed to be fast, even with large repositories. This is achieved through the use of efficient data structures and algorithms.</p>
          <li>security:</li>
          <p>Git uses hashes in two important ways. When you commit a file into your repository, Git calculates and remembers the hash of the contents of the file.<br>
             When you later retrieve the file, Git can verify that the hash of the data being retrieved exactly matches the hash that was computed when it was stored.</p>  
          <li>Open Source: </li>
          <p> Git is an open-source project, which means that anyone can contribute to its development.<br>
             This has led to a large community of users and contributors who provide support and contribute new features.</p>
           
           <li>Work flow</li>
           <p>The most popular Git development workflow and the entry stage of every project. The idea is simple: there is one central repository.<br>
             Each developer clones the repo, works locally on the code, creates a commit with changes, and pushes it to the central repository for other developers to pull and use in their work</p>
          <li>scalable</li>
            <p>Git LFS lets you push files that are larger than the storage limit to GitHub.<br>
               It does this by storing references to the file in the repository, but not the actual file. In other words, Git LFS creates a pointer file that acts as a reference to the actual file, which will be stored somewhere else.</p>
          <li>Supports non-linear development in git</li>
          <p>Git allows users from all over the world to perform operations on a project remotely.<br>
             A user can pick up any part of the project and do the required operation and then further update the project. This can be done by the Non-linear development behavior of the Git</p>
             
            <li>backup</li>
          <p>GitHub can be used for:
      
            Backup your code on cloud. Coolaborate with people around the world on open and closed projects. Clone projects and use them as template. Make a virtual portfolio of your programming work.</p>

            <h1>Disadvantage of git</h1>
      <p>There are rather just a few limitations of the Git repos because, in comparison to other VCS or SVN, Git is still a #1 choice of developers for creating and storing contents of software application.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Businesses who need to use advanced GUI features have to rely on third-party software in addition to Git.</li>
        <li>The code merging tool of Git produces some time-consuming conflicts, thus it still needs some improvement.</li>
        <li>People who are used to work with CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and SubVersion or are complete newcomers will have a hard time moving and learning Git.</li>
        <li>The Git was primarily designed for the Linux kernel system, so the support for other systems would be rather slow.</li>
        <li>The force pushing the remote repo will override the code and the existing code may get lost.</li>
        <li>If any developer tries to rebase the remote repo, it will alter the commit history, which will then create issues if others try to pull the latest code from the same repo</li>

        <h2>do's of git</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Create a new repository for every new application development project.</li>
        <li>Make a habit of creating a new branch for every bug, issue, or feature addition.</li>
        <li>Commit and push changes to a remote repo so that loss of work is avoided.</li>
        <li>Use gitignore in project files so that Git repo can ignore the untracked or unwanted files to be committed</li>
        <li>Write up a commit message with a clear and concise subject line and description of the changes made and why were they made.</li>
        <li>If something goes sideways than what actually you have planned, then stop the work and ask for help from your lead developer.<br>
           The benefit of using DVCS like Git is that any changes or modifications made are reversible and there are high chances of getting a modified repo into its original form.</li>
        <li>Run git gc periodically in the Git repos to speed them up and shrink the space consumed by them on the disk.</li>
        <li>Safeguard your important Git repo branches like master and development against any accidental loss by adding protection layer.</li>
        <li>Also, add permission to read/write to control who can access the Git repos to prevent any unauthorized use.</li>
        <li>Merge distributed feature branches once the issue, the bug is fixed or features are added into the intended branch and then delete the rest repos.</li>
        <li>Also, make a habit to create a pull request when merging the one repo branch to another.</li>
        <li>Review the code changes you have made before going to create a pull request.</li>  
      </ul>
      <h2>don'ts of git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t commit changed or modified branch to the master or development branch directly.</li>
        <li>Refrain from making commit of application secrets in public repos.</li>
        <li>Don’t name master and develop branches of repos with names like “Master” or “Develop/Development.”</li>
        <li>Don’t change/delete the history of published repos.</li>
        <li>Don’t make large commits because it can intermix the multiple unconnected changes.</li>
      <li>Also, don’t commit large binaries to any Git repo because it will eat up the large chunk of storage space required to clone by others.</li>
      <li>Refrain from working on multiple issues in one branch, if any feature is dropped, it might get hard to revert changes</li>
      <li>Don’t reset a distributed branch before committing change/modifications, because after doing so you will lose all the changes.</li>
      <li>Don’t create one pull request that addresses more than one or two issues.</li>

          Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.<br>
          Thomas Dohmke - Chief Executive Officer - GitHub <br>
          Founding. Development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007. The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as a beta release<br>
          But by 2018, Microsoft had already become one of the heaviest users of GitHub and was maintaining many of the most actively developed<br>
          June 2018, Microsoft said it was buying GitHub for a whopping $7.5 billion.</p>

          <h1>Version control systems</h1>
          <p> VCS are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time</p>
          <p> version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.<br>
             They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.</p>
        <p>Software developers working in teams are continually writing new source code and changing existing source code. The code for a project, app or software component <br>
          is typically organized in a folder structure or "file tree". One developer on the team may be working on a new feature while another developer fixes an unrelated bug by changing code,<br>
           each developer may make their changes in several parts of the file tree.
          Version control helps teams solve these kinds of problems, tracking every individual change by each contributor and helping prevent concurrent work from conflicting.</p>

                  Team Foundation Server is Microsoft's "all-in-one" Application Lifecycle Management solution. It contains capabilities for Agile project management,<br>
                  source control, continuous integration (build), continuous delivery (release), manual test case management, and more. It also has SharePoint integration and a data warehouse to facilitate easy reporting.<br>
                  It's been around for about 10 years now, introduced in 2005 as Visual Studio Team System. Since then it's received 5 major versions (2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, and now 2015)<br>
                  with innumerable service packs, patches, and quarterly updates.
                  TFS is an on-premise solution, consisting of (in a best-practices style setup) anywhere from 2 to 5 servers.
                  There is no such thing as "Team Foundation Service" anymore. It's called Visual Studio Team Services these days. Team Services is "TFS in the cloud", hosted and maintained by Microsoft in the Azure data centers. <br>
                  It's the exact same codebase as TFS on-prem, except it's updated more frequently (every 3 weeks). There are some capabilities in TFS on-prem that aren't available in Team Services and vice versa. For example,<br>
                   Team Services does not have SharePoint integration or reporting. The upside here is that there's no infrastructure to maintain or software to <br>
                  upgrade -- upgrades happen every 3 weeks, with no downtime. This is a huge draw for smaller shops.
                  Team Foundation Version Control is one of the two native options for source control in TFS/Team Services. It's a centralized version control system, similar in paradigm to Subversion.</p>

              </li><li>Mercurial is a free, distributed version control system. It's also referred to as a revision control system or Mercurial source control. It is used by software development teams to manage and track changes across projects. <br>
                It launched in 2005. But its popularity has since faded. It still has a handful of large development organizations using it — including Facebook, Mozilla, and World Wide Web Consortium (W3).<br>
                 But it only has about 2% of the VCS market share.</li>
                 <li>his is also one of the reasons that Mercurial is mostly used as a command-line tool, though there are GUI tools available. Mercurial has been the version <br>
                  control system used by big brands like Adium, Mozilla, Netbeans, Vim, Growl and so forth. Apart from these, a lot of individual developers use Mercurial to manage their code.</li>

              <p>GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public repositories for free, but it charges for private repositories, offering various paid plans. Each public and private repository contains all of a project's files, as well as each file's revision history.<br>
                 Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private<br>
                 GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a hosting service and web interface for the Git code repository, as well as management tools for collaboration. The developer platform can be thought of as a social networking site for software developers.<br>
                  Members can follow each other, rate each other's work, receive updates for specific open source projects, and communicate publicly or privately.</p>

                <li>GitHub Gist: lets users share pieces of code or other notes.</li>
                <li>GitHub Flow: is a lightweight, branch-based workflow for regularly updated deployments</li>
                <li>GitHub Pages: are static webpages to host a project, pulling information directly from an individual's or organization's GitHub repository.</li>
                <li>GitHub Desktop: lets users access GitHub from Windows or Mac desktops, rather than going to GitHub's website.</li>
                <li>GitHub Student Developer Pack: is a free offering of developer tools for students. It includes cloud resources, programming tools and support, and GitHub access.</li>
              <li>GitHub Campus Experts: is a program students can use to become leaders at their schools and develop technical communities there.</li>
            <li>GitHub CLI: is a free, open source command-line tool that brings GitHub features, such as pull requests, to a user's local terminal. This capability eliminates the need to switch contexts when coding, streamlining workflows.</li>  
            <li>GitHub Codespaces: is a cloud-based development environment that gives users access to common programming languages and tools. The coding environment runs in a container and gives users a certain amount of free time before switching to a paid pricing model.</li>

                   Applying a Git patch involves taking someone's work and adding it to your local Git repository.<br>
                   <br>
                   The git am command is used to import commits from email patches in the . mbox format, while git apply is used to directly apply the output of the git diff command as a new commit.<br>
                    So git am and git apply serve very similar functions - adding new commits to your local branch based on some previously generated changes.</h3>
